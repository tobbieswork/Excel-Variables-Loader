# Import Google Sheets Variables

This plugin synchronizes from Google Sheets to Figma Variables. It supports multiple columns as well as simple key-value forms.

## Set up

1. Enter a name for the collection. If the collection exists, delete it and add it again.
2. Except for the variable names, describe the modes (columns) separated by commas.
